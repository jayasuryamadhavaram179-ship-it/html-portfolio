<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in web development.
  I'm currently learning frontend development and building projects using HTML and CSS to
  understand how websites work.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy learning step by step and improving my skills through practice.
  As part of my learning journey, I have created projects like movie ranking page and
  birthday invite website.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently focusing on frontend development, and soon I plan to start learning
  backend technologies to become a full-stack developer.
  My goal is to build real-world applications and grow as a software developer.
